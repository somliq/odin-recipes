This is my first project, a guided project to be exact

It doesn't seem much, but we all have to start somewhere. One step at a time, yes, One day at a time.

Introduction:

This will be a showcase of my HTML skills I've acquired while learning in The Odin Project.

I'm expecting to not be a HTML expert once I've finished this course, but a builder, someone who knows what he's doing.
